This web application is handled as a daily To-Do-List.

## Description

In this To-Do-List you will be able to add tasks by hitting the "Submit task button", mark them as complete with the "Task Complete! button" , and delete tasks from To-Do-List using the "Delete Task!".

## Usage

- To begin, you will add a ToDo-List item by clicking on the submit task button.

- Once submitted you may either click the task complete button to be greeted with a green background acknowledging that you have completed the task.
- To delete a task simply click the delete task button.

I designed this interface with simplicity in mind.
